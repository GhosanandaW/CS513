## Overview
This repository shows the overall data cleaning process and provenance of NYPL data for the U1 analysis

U1 target (main) use case: Analysis of the evolution of prominence (in terms of image size compared to menu size) and its correlation to price of specific dishes across different decades in New York.

## Description
The goal of this analysis is to understand how the prominence of specific dishes, as indicated by the image size relative to the total menu area, has evolved over different decades in New York and how it affected the price. This involves examining the changes in how dishes are visually represented on menus and identifying trends in menu design and dish popularity over time and its effect on pricing.
